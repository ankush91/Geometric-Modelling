************READ-ME***********

-> Features of Code : The code is implemented as modular as possible and command-line arguments are set as parameters to "Parameters" Class.
bezier is the function which implements the general bezier curve equation.
Functions are present to print out the curve coordinates and control points to the console in .iv format

->Language of Choice and OS: The code is implemented in C++ on the tux (Linux) platform and would require the g++ compiler to compile.

->Name of File containing Main: Source.cpp is the name of the file containting main()

*****HOW-TO-RUN****
->cd into the directory of the folder containing Source.cpp and make
->Type in make to compile. This produces an executable of the format CG_hw1
->Type in ./CG_hw1 [command-line parameters][-f filename.txt -u du -r radius] to run the code
-> Follow the run-time command by > [filename].iv to redirect the output to [filename].iv format

******EXTRA-NOTES****
-> You can type make rm to remove executable CG_hw1 and run again
-> Default File cpts_in.txt contain some default points. You could modify that file itself
-> Please let me know if you face any issues
