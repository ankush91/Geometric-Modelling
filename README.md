 # Geometric Modelling: Curves & Surfaces
This folder contains corresponding code for graduate level Computer Graphics Class (CS 536) taught at drexel university. The main features of the class were 2D and 3D curve and surface geometric modelling. </br>

## Repository Structure
The algorithms as part of corresponding folders include: </br>
* Arbitrary Degree Bezier Curves
* Bicubic Bezier Patches
* Catmull Rom Splines 
* Superellipsoids 
* Hierarchical models </br>

## Additional Notes
* The readme.txt file in each of the above folder(s) outlines code features & further instructions pertaining to compiling and running code
* The code is implemented in C++ (.cpp) and the output files are generated in open inventor (.iv) format
