 # Geometric Modelling: Curves & Surfaces
This folder contains corresponding code for graduate level Computer Graphics Class (CS 536) taught at Drexel University. The main features of the class were 2D and 3D curve and surface geometric modelling in Fall, 2016. </br>

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented in different subdirectories: </br>
* Arbitrary Degree Bezier Curves
* Bicubic Bezier Patches
* Catmull Rom Splines 
* Superellipsoids 
* Hierarchical models </br>

### Notes:
* The README in each of the above subdirs details source code as well as instructions pertaining to compiling and running code.
* All code is implemented in C++ (.cpp) and output graphs are rendered in open-inventor (.iv).
