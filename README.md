 # Geometric Modelling: Curves & Surfaces
Implementations of fundamental 2D and 3D curve and surface geometric modelling algorithms. This was part of graduate level coursework in a Computer Graphics Class (CS 536) taught at Drexel University in Fall, 2016.  </br>

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented: </br>
* [Arbitrary Degree Bezier Curves](./Arbitrary%20Degree%20Bezier%20Curves/)
* [Bicubic Bezier Patches](./Bicubic%20Bezier%20Patches/)
* [Catmull Rom Splines](./Catmull%20Rom%20Splines/)
* [Superellipsoids](./Superellipsoids/)
* [Hierarchical models](./Hierarchical%20Models/) </br>

### Notes
* The README in each of the above subdirs details source code as well as instructions pertaining to compiling and running code
* All code is implemented in C++ (.cpp) and output graphs are rendered in open-inventor (.iv)
