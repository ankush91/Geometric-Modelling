 # Geometric-Modelling
This folder contains corresponding code for graduate level Computer Graphics Class (CS 536) taught at drexel university. The main features of the class were 2D and 3D curve and surface geometric modelling. </br>

The algorithms as part of corresponding folders include </br>
* Arbitrary Degree Bezier Curves
* Bicubic Bezier Patches
* Catmull Rom Splines 
* Superellipsoids 
* Hierarchical models </br>

The readme.txt file in each folder outlines further instructions pertaining to this code.  </br>

The code is implemented in C++ and the output files are generated in open inventor (.iv) format.
