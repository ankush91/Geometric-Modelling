 # Geometric Modelling: Curves & Surfaces
This folder contains corresponding code for graduate level Computer Graphics Class (CS 536) taught at drexel university. The main features of the class were 2D and 3D curve and surface geometric modelling. </br>

## Repository Structure
The following algorithms are implemented: </br>
* Arbitrary Degree Bezier Curves
* Bicubic Bezier Patches
* Catmull Rom Splines 
* Superellipsoids 
* Hierarchical models </br>

## Additional Notes
* The README in each of the above subdirs details source code + instructions pertaining to compiling and running code.
* All code is implemented in C++ (.cpp) and output graphs are rendered in open-inventor (.iv).
