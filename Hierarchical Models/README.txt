************READ-ME***********

-> Features of Code : The code is implemented as modular as possible and command-line arguments are set as parameters to "Parameters" Class. 
"cuboid()" is the general function to compute cuboids according to the link number or iteration number.

Additional Functions are present for matrix multiplications and to print out the points to the console in .iv format. 

->Language of Choice and OS: The code is implemented in C++ on the tux (Linux) platform and would require the g++ compiler to compile.

->Name of File containing Main: Source.cpp is the name of the file containting main()

*****HOW-TO-RUN****
->cd into the directory of the folder containing Source.cpp and the make file.
->Type in "make" to compile. This produces an executable of the format CG_hw5
->Type in "./CG_hw5 -t [theta1] -u [theta2] -v [theta3] -l [L1_value] -m [L2_value] -n [L3_value]" to run the code
-> Follow the run-time command by > [filename].iv to redirect the output to [filename].iv format

******EXTRA-NOTES****
-> You can type "make rm" to remove executable the CG_hw5 and run again.
-> Please let me know if you face any issues
